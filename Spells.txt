Don't worry if you have doubts about something! Iterate and discover how it works out!

Don't be afraid to innovate on things that have already been made, and make something still unique and awesome.

Idea for information hiding: You don't see your opponent's spell selections and must learn what they have from what they cast. 
Introduce some mechanic that makes ultimate level spells take some time to come into play. 

For songs, idea of different levels/speeds/rhythms
But also like the idea of having a sudden death at the end of a song
Also certain songs or spells that change cast time and/or cooldown time 

Fire Bolt: After a few beats, a flaming crossbow materializes and shoots a rapid bolt of fire.
  So imagine this- Mage sees that spell is castable. Mage stays in place and signs a fire rune (pressing the spell button + direction)
    and next beat he moves normally (or maybe can cast a spell idk?) and the ground he was on has some fire dust on it, then the next beat a fiery crossbow materializes
      and the next beat it shoots a bolt like a lance of flame in the direction they had chosen.
      
      
Magnifying glass- makes spells bigger
  but not in a programmatically consistent way (hardcoded for each spell)
    now- this might seem like a 'rough edge' and probably would be somewhat- but could steer parts of the gameplay towards a fun and interesting direction
    I do tend to like it making sense intuitively and not just vaguely, but could be interesting.
    This would have to not be a super core mechanic but more of a wild thing, even a powerup or event (so players know wacky stuff will happen)
    
    
Throw blade, grow spell and a few beats later rush to the position of the blade- from wherever you moved to, dealing damage as you pass through enemy
