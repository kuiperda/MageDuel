Fire Bolt: After a few beats, a flaming crossbow materializes and shoots a rapid bolt of fire.
  So imagine this- Mage sees that spell is castable. Mage stays in place and signs a fire rune (pressing the spell button + direction)
    and next beat he moves normally (or maybe can cast a spell idk?) and the ground he was on has some fire dust on it, then the next beat a fiery crossbow materializes
      and the next beat it shoots a bolt like a lance of flame in the direction they had chosen.
