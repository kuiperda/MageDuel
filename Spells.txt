Idea for information hiding: You don't see your opponent's spell selections and must learn what they have from what they cast. 
Introduce some mechanic that makes ultimate level spells take some time to come into play. 

For songs, idea of different levels/speeds/rhythms
But also like the idea of having a sudden death at the end of a song
Also certain songs or spells that change cast time and/or cooldown time 

Fire Bolt: After a few beats, a flaming crossbow materializes and shoots a rapid bolt of fire.
  So imagine this- Mage sees that spell is castable. Mage stays in place and signs a fire rune (pressing the spell button + direction)
    and next beat he moves normally (or maybe can cast a spell idk?) and the ground he was on has some fire dust on it, then the next beat a fiery crossbow materializes
      and the next beat it shoots a bolt like a lance of flame in the direction they had chosen.
