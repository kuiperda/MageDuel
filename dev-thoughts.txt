I like the thought of a high point being perfectly weaving a combo together like music. 

Adam said this is interesting because it combines two of my interests.
He also said that even if/when the game does get solved, it could still be a fun game to play. 
And I guess the only way to know how it will turn out is to implement it.

It's good to bounce ideas off of someone, you gain a much broader perspective that way. 


Andrew Quist gave this advice to aspiring developers- Start small. 
And don't be afraid to do something that has been done before.
He says art is derivative, and not to be afraid to borrow things. Mixing things creatively is a great idea.
Figure out what's unique about your game and lean into that.
Polishing one simple mechanic feels a lot better than introducing many rough edges. 
Simplicity and elegance is really good- set limits on feature creep to keep things manageable.

KCA: Never stop asking questions. 

Lots of good advice in those notes, and from talking to people.
I see now that I am capable of creating art in this medium. I have much less holding me back than I used to. 
I could make something really cool. Something that matters to people. 

I have a lot to learn, and trying things out is a great place to start.
